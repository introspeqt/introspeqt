##Current Status

### What it does

* Outputs a text file listing all widgets of a given `QApplication` and the amount of times they've been clicked. 
* Support for multiple `QEvents`

### Limitations

* Does not output data to other formats other than text files.
* Unable to specify which widgets we want to get information from.
* Output is for one session only. Running the application again replaces output.
* Works with standalone applications but not in hosts that have an event loop already running.
