Introspeqt documentation
==========================

Why
---

We all know that it is quite difficult to know how people use the tools that we
make for them. If we ask the user what do they think of the tool, we tend to
get a polite reply instead of honest feedback. Another option is to stand
behind their back observing what they do with the tool. Even though that this
method works, it adds pressure on the user and they don't feel comfortable with
you standing so close as they feel like you are judging them.

`introspeqt` is an easy to use introspection tool that allows you to gather
information about how users use your tool without the need to stand behind
their backs.

This information will be an accurate representation of the usage of your tools.
You'll be able to see which parts of the interface are used the most, which
ones are not used at all as well as the approach that each user took to get a
given task accomplished.

All of that translates on meaningful information when it comes to work on the
next iteration of the tool as you will know how your tools are used.

You can also use the information provided by `introspeqt` to reflect on the
knowledge that the users have of your tools so you can provide them with
additional documentation/training when necessary.

If you have any comments, don't hesitate to let me know.
